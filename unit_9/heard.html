<h1>Contrary to reports, there is a lot of good music out there. You just need to know where to find it</h1>
	<p> <h2>1975- I Like It When You Are Asleep For You Are So Beautiful Yet So Unaware Of It</h2>
Fiona Apple's record for longest album title still holds, but the 1975 almost took it away from her. Music wise, I am always happy when a band exceeds expectations and proves me wrong from their debut. There's some really great throwbacks to 80s new wave bands in their new sound, the kind that induces melancholy when you listen to it. <b> Key track: Somebody Else </b>
</p>
<p><h2>Zayn- Mind of Mine</h2>
Not quite pop, not quite RnB, Zayn's debut sounds like the happy medium between the two genres. Sensual and melodic, it calls to mind Frank Ocean, Miguel and The Weeknd. A very strong debut, proving that perhaps he was right to leave the all-mighty One Direction after all. <b> Key Track: Rear View</b>
</p>
<p><h2>Kanye West- The Life of Pablo </h2>
The enigmatic Mr West strikes again with the ever evolving TLOP. Described as a living, breathing art work, the album has gone through several iterations, but in its current form, is part gospel, part rap and part old-school Kanye. It takes best the parts of Kanye's oevre and reinvents them. If Yeezus was Kanye at his angriest, this is the anti-thesis of this- he is in full reflective meditative mode. <b> Key Track: Wolves</b>
