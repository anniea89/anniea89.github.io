<h1>Things that I've gone to around Sydney. Could be a festival. Could be a random event.</h1>
	 <h2>Bowie Tribute week- Hyde Park, Oxford Art Factory and Plan B: January</h2>
<p>After the death of icon David Bowie, many impromptu tribute events were held all around the world. Sydney cobbled together a few and I went along to join in and process my grief.
</br>
<b>Hyde Park</b> staged a Bowie evening in the park were people were encouraged to dress up and join in on what was essentially a massive singalong. As this was a mere three days after the announcement that he had passed, it was quite raw and moving to see people from all ages and all walks of life sharing the moment and bonding over his music.
</br>
<b>Oxford Art Factory</b> held a Bowie dance party. Dance parties are great fun when you're not by yourself. Unfortnately, I was and as much as I loved the playlist for the evening, it was not enough to make me want to dance awkwardly in front of strangers.
</br>
<b> Plan B</b> held a Bowie and Labryinth trivia evening. I love the trivia nights here, they can sometimes be a bit drawn out but are almost always a fun night. I prepared myself by watching Labryinth and reading Wikipedia. Ended up placing second and won myself a copy of The Man Who Fell To Earth on blu-ray.
