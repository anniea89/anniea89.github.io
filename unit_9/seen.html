<h1>There is nothing I love more than venturing out into the wild to my local cineplex to catch a good film. Or even a bad one.</h1>

Gondry but not as you know it. A great coming of age story from Michel Gondry. It doesn’t have all the quirks of his style, but it feels right to have that pulled back a bit to let the two characters shine, reminding me of ‘Be Kind Rewind’. Great comedic turn from Audrey Tatou as a neurotic mother as well.
