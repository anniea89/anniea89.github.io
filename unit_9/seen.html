<h1>There is nothing I love more than venturing out into the wild to my local cineplex to catch a good film. Or even a bad one.</h1>
	<p> <h2>Microbe and Gasoline</h2>

Gondry but not as you know it. A great coming of age story from Michel Gondry. It doesn’t have all the quirks of his style, but it feels right to have that pulled back a bit to let the two characters shine, reminding me of ‘Be Kind Rewind’. Great comedic turn from Audrey Tatou as a neurotic mother as well.

<p><h2>My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2</h2>
Bigger. Fatter. Greekier. The first film is practically iconic in my house, so this film had high standards to live up to. I’m happy to report it’s just as good as its predecessor. I can’t pick a favourite moment to be honest, there were constant laugh out loud moments in the cinema. Aunt Toula, however, is a scene stealer and I would pay big bucks just for a spin off film about her dragging Taki around. There’s also a beautiful storyline involving Joey Fatone’s character which I thought was done really well.

<p><h2>Deadpool</h2>
I am not one for superhero/comic book films, but Deadpool has the right amount of meta-ness and sarcastic asshole that made me actually enjoy one of these for once

Still fell asleep during the action sequences tho #sorrynotsorry
