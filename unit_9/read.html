<h1>Here are some reviews of books that I've read recently that I would 3000% recommend</h1>
	<p> <h2>Jasper Jones</h2>

	This may be one of the best Australian novels I've read recently, if not one of the best novels overall.

It's not an exaggeration to draw comparisons to 'To Kill A Mockingbird' here, as it feels like 'Jasper Jones' is quite worthy of that praise. We learn that the lines between good and bad, justice and injustice are never clear and that the truth is something that we don't always want to hear. Finally, through protagonist Charlie Bucktin, we also learn something about what it means to face your fears and prevail through adversity.

Beautifully written and poignant, even at its darkest.
